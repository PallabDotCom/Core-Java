 * Nancy teaches numbers to his little son, Peter. She gives her son a number and a single-digit and asked him to count the number of times that single-digit appears in that number. Help her to do this by writing a Java program.

Note: 

Program should get 2 inputs from the user, a number and a single digit. The number should not be less than 1, if so print "<Number> falls behind the limit". The number should not have more than 9 digits, if so print "<Number> exceeds the limit". The Second input should be a single-digit number. If not, print "<Input> is not valid". If the digit is not present in the number print "<Digit> is not available in <Number>".
